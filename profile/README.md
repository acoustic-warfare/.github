## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Below you'll find what repos contain which code. In each Repo another readme explains how to use it. Last years report about the work is found [here](https://github.com/acoustic-warfare/Beamforming/blob/main/Ljudkriget.pdf).

# Acoustic warfare
### [beamforming-lk](https://github.com/acoustic-warfare/beamforming-lk)
Digital signal processing of audio sampling

### [FPGA-sampling](https://github.com/acoustic-warfare/FPGA-sampling)
Sampling of microphone arrays

# RF

### [RF](https://github.com/acoustic-warfare/RF)

# Wara PS
### [WARA-PS-MQTT-Agent](https://github.com/acoustic-warfare/WARA-PS-MQTT-Agent)
MQTT Bridge for beamforming and WARA PS MQTT API for control and sensor output

### [RtmpStreamer](https://github.com/acoustic-warfare/RtmpStreamer)
